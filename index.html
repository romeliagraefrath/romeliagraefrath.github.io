      I’m a versatile writer with a background in academic research, nonprofit communications strategy, and policy analysis.
    </p>
     <p>
      I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Notre Dame. 
    </p>
      <p>
     My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals and public-facing outlets like <i>The Washington Post</i>.
    </p>
     <p>
     Previously, I served as Co-Executive Director at Mariposa Legal, a nonprofit providing legal services to immigrant communities.

      Now, I'm bringing passion and people-centered storytelling to sports branding, where energy, identity, and impact converage.
